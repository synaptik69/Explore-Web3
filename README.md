## Explore Solana Uses Custom Template - Open Source Directory Template with Solid Design

Explore Solana custom template is an open-source directory template built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript.

Created by [Solomon Foskaay](https://x.com/SolomonFoskaay) of [dProgrammingUniversity](https://dProgrammingUniversity.com) for [Explore Solana](https://ExploreWeb3.xyz) Project.

I had to build the project from scratch (in about 2 months) after I bought a directory template from Themeforest that didn't work (Cool - I was able to get a refund!) and couldn't find free quality template out there with up-to-date integration with Nextjs /app directory.

## Explore Solana Uses Custom Template

This project merges a custom directory design with the responsive shell from the Solid SaaS template to create a comprehensive platform for discovering Solana projects.

The goal is to provide an intuitive, visually appealing, and functional directory for Solana projects, complete with necessary integrations and features.

Solid is a free Next.js template specifically crafted for startups, SaaS, and software websites. It provides an extensive array of necessary sections, elements, and pages required to build a fully-equipped website.

This project leverages the responsive design from Solid while integrating a custom-built directory to suit the specific needs of the Solana community.
